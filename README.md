## Are women worse at chess? Answering stupid questions using numerical methods

<p>In this repository, the complete code used in the document LINK is shown. FIDE data can be found <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/">here</a> (although it needs to be corrected due to the missmatching of one of the rows).</p>

<p>The code have been divided in two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <b> read_FIDE.py </b> </li>
  <li> <b> chess_ratings.py </b> </li>
</ul>

<p>The first one reads the FIDE data and plot some relevant information while the second generates simulated data and compares it with the one provided by FIDE.</p>
